# zlentz-config
This repo exists to host my current bashrc, vimrc, etc., so I can keep them sync'd between different systems. There's probably no reason for anyone else to use this repo, but feel free to use it as an example, good or bad.

The install script backs up the user's current configuration files and creates symbolic links to these. This is so I can git pull origin master and not have to change anything else when I update my configurations on a different system.

The files in the repo omit the leading period so that I can edit the repo without fumbling around for hidden files.
